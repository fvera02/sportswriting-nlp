In-Form Monfils Extends Perfect Record Against Cilic In Dubai
Gael Monfils, the in-form Frenchman who is staking a claim for a return to his peak-performance days, extended his perfect winning streak to 4-0 over Marin Cilic on Tuesday evening at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships.
The athletic Monfils, a winner of his eighth ATP Tour title two weeks ago at the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam, recorded his 10th win in 12 matches this year with a 6-3, 4-6, 6-0 victory over the third-seeded Croatian in one hour and 45 minutes.
The 32-year-old Monfils will now meet Cypriot 2015 finalist Marcos Baghdatis, who got the better of fellow wild card Mohamed Safwat of Egypt 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in one hour and 53 minutes.
Monfils got off to a fine start by breaking serve in the first game, when Cilic hooked a forehand wide, and completed the set when his Croatian opponent committed another forehand error.
Cilic, a two-time quarter-finalist at the Aviation Club (2009-10), broke Monfils to love for a 3-2 advantage in the second set. He needed three chances to wrap up the set, which ended with a backhand error from Monfils. But Monfils regrouped and won 24 of 29 total points in the decider to improve to 10-2 on the season.
Two days after lifting his second ATP Tour title in Marseille, Stefanos Tsitsipas defeated Matthew Ebden 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 to record his 12th win in 16 tour-level encounters this season. The reigning Next Gen ATP Finals winner won 92 per cent of first-serve points (34/37) to claim victory after one hour and 43 minutes. Aiming to reach the quarter-finals in Dubai for the second straight year, Tsitsipas will meet Egor Gerasimov in the second round. The Belarusian qualifier edged Robin Haase 7-6(2), 7-6(5).
Borna Coric withstood 12 aces to edge lucky loser Jiri Vesely 7-5, 3-6, 7-6(4). The 2015 semi-finalist improves to 7-3 at the event and will meet Tomas Berdych for a quarter-final spot. The in-form Czech also required a final-set tie-break to advance, beating another lucky loser, Ilya Ivaskha, 6-4, 4-6, 7-6(4) in two and a half hours.

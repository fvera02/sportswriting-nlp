Ram/Salisbury Book Dubai Doubles Final Spot
Two weeks after falling to Jean-Julien Rojer and Horia Tecau in the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament semi-finals, Rajeev Ram and Joe Salisbury defeated the Dutch-Romanian duo 7-6(4), 6-3 on Friday to reach the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships final.
Competing in their third tour-level semi-final of the season (2-1), Ram and Salisbury dropped just eight points on serve (50/57) to overcome the Rotterdam finalists in 79 minutes. The fourth seeds, who improve to 10-4 in 2019, have not dropped a set en route to their second final of 2019. Last month, Ram and Salisbury opened their season with a run to the Brisbane International championship match (l. to Daniell/Koolhof).
Ram and Salisbury will meet Ben McLachlan and Jan-Lennard Struff for the title on Saturday. McLachlan and Struff, who defeated top seeds Oliver Marach and Mate Pavic to reach the last four, saved one match point to beat Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan and Purav Raja 6-7(5), 6-4, 12-10 in one hour and 37 minutes.
McLachlan and Struff recovered from 8/9 down in the Match Tie-break to book their place in the championship match. The Japanese-German pairing is bidding to lift its second ATP Tour title of the season after triumphing at the ASB Classic in January (d. Klaasen/Venus). McLachlan and Struff also defeated Raven Klaasen and Michael Venus to lift their maiden team title at the Rakuten Japan Open Tennis Championships last October.

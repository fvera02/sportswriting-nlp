Chile's Garin Showing He Belongs On ATP Tour
Chile's Christian Garin won his maiden ATP Tour match when he was only 16 years old. Garin received a wild card into the Vina del Mar in Chile six years ago, and the teenager upset Serbian Dusan Lajovicin straight sets.
Six years later, Garin is showing he has what it takes to stick around on the ATP Tour. The 22-year-old won his opening contest for the third consecutive week on Monday at the Brasil Open in Sao Paulo.
Garin dismissed Portugal's Pedro Sousa 7-6(3), 6-2 to advance at the ATP 250. He will face Brazilian qualifier Pedro Sakamoto or sixth seed Jaume Munar of Spain.
Argentina's Marco Trungelliti, who had the famous ride with Grandma to last year's Roland Garros, earned the upset of the day, beating eighth seed Taro Daniel 6-4, 3-6, 7-6(5). The Argentine will face Swede Elias Ymer or Brazilian wild card Thiago Seyboth Wild, the reigning US Open Boys' Singles champion.
Italy's Lorenzo Sonego secured a second-round meeting with fourth seed Leonardo Mayer of Argentina with a 6-4, 6-4 win against Federico Delbonis, and Spain's Roberto Carballes Baena, the 2018 Quito Open titlist, knocked out Germany's Maximilian Marterer 3-6, 6-1, 6-2. Baena will face third seed Guido Pella for a place in the quarter-finals.

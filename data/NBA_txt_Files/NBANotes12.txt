ThundeRuss Paul-Stars: Paul George and Russell Westbrook were once again named 2019 NBA All-Stars. Named a starter for this year’s game, George made his sixth-career All-Star appearance and third start. Westbrook made his eighth-career All-Star appearance. This marks the 10th-consecutive season that the Thunder has had at least one All-Star selection, a streak that ranks second only to the San Antonio Spurs (21). Additionally, Hamidou Diallo was named the 2019 All-Star Dunk Contest Champion. Stealing the Show: Oklahoma City leads the league for both the most steals per contest (10.17) and the most turnovers forced per game (17.5). This is the second-straight season that OKC has led the league in each of these categories as last season the team averaged 9.06 steals per game and 16.0 opponent turnovers per game. Prior to the 2017-18 campaign, the Thunder had never finished within the Top 5 in the NBA in these categories. Additionally, the Thunder ranks first on the leaderboards for points off opponent turnovers (20.8). Paul George ranks first in the NBA with 2.29 steals per contest, just ahead of Russell Westbrook with 2.13. Everyone Deserves a Second Chance: As a team that creates the most second chances for themselves, OKC ranks second in the league in offensive rebounding (12.3) and ranks third in second chance points (14.8), giving themselves 4.7 more shots per game than opponents, good for best in the NBA. The Thunder is also winning the game in transition, ranking first in preventing opponent shots in transition (18.6 percent) and taking the second-most shots in transition as a team (28.4 percent). Hot Schröder: In the second quarter on 2/1 at Miami, Dennis Schröder went a perfect 9-for-9 from the floor, the best shooting in a single quarter ever by a Thunder player (Anthony Morrow 8-8 FG on 11/12/14). Additionally, he went 4-for-4 from beyond the arc. The last NBA player to shoot as well in a quarter was Klay Thompson (13-13 FG, 9-9 3FG on 1/23/15). By George, He’s Doing It: In the win over Miami on 2/1, Paul George drained 10 shots from long range to set a new OKC record. On 12/10 vs. Utah, he went 8-for-10 from the field and 5-for-6 from long range to score a game-high 31 points, making him the first player in Thunder history to score at least 30 points on 10 attempts or less and one of two players to do so in the last 10 years (Khris Middleton). George is also averaging career-highs in points, rebounds, assists, steals and three-pointers this season. Getting Defensive: Oklahoma City holds the third-best defensive rating in the league (105.7), ranks first in deflections per game (16.1) and first in loose balls recovered (9.9). The Thunder is also allowing opponents to score the eighth-fewest fast break points (12.4). One Ferg the Record Books: On 1/8 vs. Minnesota, Terrance Ferguson went a perfect 4-for-4 from beyond the arc to tally 14 points, making him the eighth player in Thunder history to go 4-of-4 or better from three-point range (Butler, Durant, Fisher, Ibaka, Martin, Telfair, Westbrook). From 1/8 to 2/1, he went 32-for-62 (.516) from long range, good for best in the NBA in that timeframe (min. 50 attempts). Don’t Call it a Comeback: Following an 0-4 start to the season, Oklahoma City has gone 38-18, the third-most wins in the NBA since Oct. 28. During that timeframe, the Thunder has held the most steals per game and the third-highest net rating. Individually, Paul George has grabbed the most steals (125) just ahead of Russell Westbrook (111) and holds the best +/- rating in the league (+9.2) while Steven Adams holds best shooting percentage on the team (61.0) with Nerlens Noel (55.7) and Jerami Grant (53.6) right behind.

In Friday’s quadruple-overtime victory at Atlanta, Zach LaVine notched a career-high 47 points on 17-35 shooting from the field as well as a season-high six 3-pointers. It was LaVine’s second 40-point effort in the last four games as well as his third of the season. LaVine is one of three Bulls in the last 20 years to have three or more 40-point games in a single season. LaVine joins Michael Jordan (twice) and Ben Gordon (2006-07) as the only three Bulls age 23 or younger in franchise history with three or more 40-point games in a single season. With Zach LaVine’s 42 points and Lauri Markkanen’s career-high 35 on Feb. 23 against Boston, they were the first pair of Bulls to score 35+ in the same game since Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen each scored 37 on Nov. 20, 1996. LaVine’s 42 points were scored on a career-high 17 field goals and only three free throws. LaVine is the fifth player this season to score 42 or more points while making three or fewer shots from the foul line. He also joins Michael Jordan (five times) as the only Bulls to do it in club history. Markkanen’s career-high 35 points came with 15 rebounds, making him the 10th player this season and just the 11th player in team history with 35+ and 15+ rebounds in a single game. Markkanen has been one of the hottest players in the NBA in recent games. The second-year forward has double-digit rebounds in 12 of his last 14 games, with all 10+ rebound games becoming double-doubles. From Feb. 6 through Feb. 11, he put up 20+ points and 10+ rebounds in four- straight games, one of four Bulls in franchise history to do so. Those four double-double games are tied for the longest streak of his career. Otto Porter Jr. had a career night in the final contest before the All-Star break. In his fourth game for Chicago, he scored a career-high 37 points, marking the third-highest total by a Bulls player this year. Additionally, he has knocked down multiple 3-pointers in seven of his eight games as a Bull. Additionally, Porter Jr. sank a career-high seven 3-pointers in Friday’s contest at Atlanta. From Feb. 6 through Feb. 25, Robin Lopez had a season-long streak of eight consecutive games scoring in double-figures. Additionally. Lopez scored 17 or more points in six-straight contests from Feb. 9 through Feb. 25, which was the longest streak of his career. Zach LaVine has scored 20+ in 13 of his last 17 games and has 41 games with 20 or more points this season. Additionally, from Feb. 6 through Feb. 11, LaVine scored 20+ points and five or more assists in four-straight games for the first time in his career. LaVine extended his assists streak to six games, which was a career-long streak and the second-longest streak by a Bulls player this season. Shaquille Harrison is one of two players in the NBA this season to average more than one steal per game while playing fewer than 18 minutes per contest (min. 40 games played). Harrison has notched a steal in 10 of his last 14 games and recorded three steals at Orlando on Feb. 22. Harrison is one of seven players in 2018-19 with at least 14 games recording two or more steals off the bench.

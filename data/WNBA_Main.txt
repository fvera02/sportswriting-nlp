Coming into the game, she had 1200 assists and only needed six more to move up. Since that game, Vandersloot has moved to No. 12 all-time assist leader, and is 72 more assists from being 10th. YOUNG TEAM As one of the younger teams in the WNBA, the Sky calls on rookies to play some valuable minutes. Through veteran guidance and under the leadership of Coach Stocks, the Sky hopes to capitalize on its youth this season ROOKIES RULE Diamond DeShields is the team’s second leading scorer averaging 13.6 PPG, which ranks third in rookie scoring. DeShields also ranks second in rookie re- bounding. Forward Gabby Williams leads the WNBA in steals per game (1.8), and she ranks third in rookie rebounding at 5.2 RPG.

In the press conference after the game, Coach Stocks said, “They were moving the basketball, playing well together, attacking the rim, and what was most evident today was the energy and passion inside of the arena ignited by our entire team. Those sitting on the sidelines gave great energy and excitement to their teammates on the court, and that was contagious.” SKY PLAYOFF HISTORY In 2013, the Chicago Sky faced o against longtime rival Indiana Fever in the Eastern Conference Semi nals. The following year, 2014, the Sky made it into the playo s as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference, sporting a 15-19 record. Anything can happen in the playo s, and the Sky proved that. In the Eastern Con- ference Semi nals, the Sky knocked out the number one seeded Atlanta Dream 2-1 in a three game series. The Eastern Conference Finals featured a rematch of the previous year’s Semi nal with the Sky taking on the Indiana Fever. This time it was the Sky who came out ahead, defeating Indiana 2-1 in a three game series. In the Sky’s rst ever WNBA Finals appearance they took on the Phoenix Mercury. The streak of playo appearances continued into 2015 for the Sky. Finishing with a 21-13 record, Chicago came in as the number two seed. Their opponent in the Eastern Conference Semi nals was a familiar one in the Indiana Fever. The Sky made their fourth overall and fourth consecutive playo appearance in franchise history in 2016. ____________________SUGAR RODGERS MISSES GAME AT WASHINGTON Guard Sugar Rodgers did not dress in the Liberty’s game at Washington on June 29, missing the contest with a lower back injury su ered during the 3rd quarter of New York’s game against Connecticut onJune 23. Her current status is day-to-day, and she continues to be evaluated. ZELLOUS STEPPING UP HER GAME With guard Epiphanny Prince and center Kia Vaughn missing most of the month of June in order to compete in the EuroBasket Women Tourna- ment, the entire team was called on to step up and replace their production, and guard Shavonte Zellous has certainly responded in a big way and has continued to be one of the Liberty’s o ensive leaders since their return. Over the past 8 games, Zellous is 2nd on the team averaging 19.4 ppg. She posted back-to-back 20-point games for the 1st time in her career, netting 27 against Dallas on June 2, her highest point tally since pouring in a career-best 33 on June 25, 2014, and topped that with 28 points in the overtime win at Dallas on June 16. Zellous has posted double gures in 8-straight games, the 2nd longest stretch of her career, and the longest since she scored in double gures in the nal 15 games of the 2013 season, the year she was named the WNBA’s Most Improved Player. LIBERTY 1ST-EVER PRO SPORTS FRANCHISE TO PARTICIPATE IN NYC PRIDE MARCH 10-PT GAMES 0 8 20-PT GAMES 0 3 On June 25 the New York Liberty became the 1st-ever professional sports franchise to enter a oat and participate in the NYC Pride March. At- tended by current players Bria Hartley, Nayo Raincock-Ekunwe, Brittany Boyd, Rebecca Allen, Shavonte Zellous, Amanda Zahui B, and Kiah Stokes, along with associate head coach Katie Smith, all completed the march, while head coach Bill Laimbeer and Isiah Thomas were on hand for the disembark. The Liberty completed the entire route, attended by an estimated 1 million spectators. It was the culmination of the franchise’s Pride Month presented by Resorts World Casino NYC. LONGEST ROAD TRIP IN FOUR YEARS The Liberty is in the midst of its longest road trip since the 2013 season, 12 days on the road and 4-straight games away from The Garden, visiting Washington, Atlanta, Seattle, and Phoenix. That stretch saw New York play 4-straight away games from June 26-July 4. While the Liberty had 4-straight road games during a stretch in both 2015 and 2013, those were broken up by the WNBA All-Star Break each time. NEAR HISTORIC COMEBACK New York nearly completed its largest-ever comeback in erasing a 21 point de cit against the Connecticut Sun on June 23 at The Garden. After falling behind by 21 points in the 3rd quarter, New York knotted the score at 86-86 with 1:06 to play, but was unable to regain the lead. New York’s franchise record for most points overcome in a win is 20, set on August 21, 2003, when it defeated the Washington Mystics at the MCI Center, 65-60. SEASON-HIGH FOR HARTLEY Guard Bria Hartley scored in double gures in consecutive games for the 1st time this season. She scored a season-high 17 points in the Liberty’s 102-93 overtime win at Dallas on June 16, and followed that up with 13 points and a pair of 3-pointers against Connecticut on June 23. During the month of June, she averaged 9.0 ppg and has scored in double gures in 4 games, shooting 8-of-26 (.308) from 3-point range. WELCOME HOME The Liberty removed guard Epiphanny Prince and center Kia Vaughn from the temporary suspension list as they have returned to the team from their national team commitments to compete in the 2017 EuroBasket Women Tournament in the Czech Republic. To make room on the roster, New York waived guard Ameryst Alston and forward Cierra Burdick. The Liberty went 5-1 during Prince and Vaughn’s absence. In three games in the EuroBasket for the Czech Republic, Vaughn averaged 16.0 ppg and 6.0 rpg. Competing for Russia, Prince averaged 13.0 ppg, and 5.0 apg. BLOCK PARTY Led by Tina Charles and Kiah Stokes, the Liberty blocked a season-high 11 shots in its 102-93 overtime win at Dallas on June 16, with Charles swatting a season-high 4 shots, and Stokes nishing with 3 blocks. The Liberty is 2nd in the WNBA, averaging 4.4 blocks per game, trailing just Chicago (5.5). TRENDING UPWARD Rookie forward Nayo Raincock-Ekunwe continues to make more and more of an impact as she settles into her 1st WNBA season, and made her 1st career start at Washington on June 29. The 25-year old Canadian National Team player who starred at Simon Fraser University and has been playing internationally since 2013, scored in double gures in back-to-back games, setting a career high of 10 points in a win over Seattle on June 11, and matching that on June 14 at Connecticut. She ranks 3rd on the Liberty with a net plus/minus of +9.4. CHARLES SETS PLAYER OF THE WEEK RECORD WITH 23RD WIN Tina Charles repeated as the Eastern Conference Player of the Week on June 12, earning the accolade for the 23rd time in her career, which moved her past Tamika Catchings for the most Player of the Week honors in a career. In leading the Liberty to wins over Atlanta (76-61) and Seattle (94- 86) during the previous week, Charles averaged 19.5 ppg and 14.5 rpg, leading the Eastern Conference on the glass and ranking 3rd in scoring over that period. For the season, Charles ranks 4th in the WNBA in scoring (19.5 ppg) and 3rd in rebounding (9.1 rpg) _______________________CHINEY RETURNS Sun forward Chiney Ogwumike finished with a game-high 21 points, seven rebounds and two blocks in Tuesday’s win over Los Angeles.?It was her 14th double-figure scoring game and third game of the season with 20 or more points. On Sunday, she had eight points, six rebounds and a block against the Storm (7/1). Her six rebounds helped her surpass 600 for her career. Last Wednesday, she posted her fourth double-double of the season, posting 21 points and a game-high 10 rebounds in the win over Indiana. Ogwumike missed the game at Phoenix (6/16) with a bruised knee, but has been reliably productive all season, averaging 7.9 rebounds and a team-best 15.6 points per game. In a 103-92 loss at Seattle (6/15), she set a career-high with 30 points on 13-of-16 shooting. The 13 made field goals were also a career-best. She became just the 13th player in franchise history to score 30 or more in a game. Her previous career-high was 26 points on July 20, 2016 at Dallas. Ogwumike currently leads the WNBA in shooting percentage (.618). After missing 2017 follow- ing Achilles tendon surgery, Ogwumike is working her way back into form. The No. 1 pick in the 2014 WNBA Draft, she was named Rookie of the Year. She missed 2015 after micro-fracture surgery on her right knee, but returned to earn the 2016 Associated Press Comeback Player of the Year Award. She finished 2016 with 17 straight double-figure scoring games. FIELD DAY Connecticut has posted back-to-back games with less than 30 made field goals, being held to 29-of-59 at Los Angeles Tuesday and just 27-of-72 in the loss at Seattle. The Sun posted its 13th game of the season with at least 30 made field goals, including a season-high 13 made threes in the win over Indiana (6/27). The 13 made threes is tied for third-most in franchise history, and ties a franchise record for a Fever opponent. Connecticut opened the season with 30 or more field goals in 10 straight games. The Sun are averaging league-highs of 32.88 made field goals and 72.18 field goal attempts, and the team ranks fourth in shooting percentage (.456). The Sun made 42 field goals on 82 attempts (51.2 percent) at Chicago. It was the second-highest single-game field goal total in franchise history, and the second time this season Connecticut has had at least 40 made field goals. Connecticut was 40 of 64 (62.5 percent) against Los Angeles on May 24. The made field goals and shooting percentage in the win over Los Angeles were the third best single-game totals in team history. The Sun also lead the league in scoring average (86.9 ppg). TARGET PRACTICE Third-year guard Rachel Banham finished with 11 points, a career-high six assists and two rebounds in Tuesday’s win over Los Angeles. It was her third double-figure scoring game of the season, and she is now just six points shy of setting a new single-season career-high in points of 98, set last season. She currently has 93. Banham had her best night as a member of the Sun last Sunday (6/24), making all five of her three-point attempts on the way to a career best 20 points in the win over the Fever. Banham was the fourth Sun player to go a perfect 5-of-5 from three-point range, joining Kara Lawson, Tan White and Evanthia Maltsi. Her three made threes in the fourth quarter helped Connecticut break open a two-point game with a 21-8 run to start the fourth quarter. Banham graduated from the University of Minnesota as the all-time leading scorer in Big Ten history, with 3,093 career points. JONES AWAKENING Jonquel Jones posted eight points, five rebounds, two assists, two steals and a block in Tuesday’s win at Los Angeles. After a slow start to the season, she has averaged 13.0 points, 5.3 rebounds and 3.0 assists over the last three games. She finished with 10 points including two made threes, four rebounds, two assists and a block in Sunday’s loss to Seattle, surpassing 100 assists for her career. In last Wednesday’s win over Indiana, Jones recorded a season-high 21 points, seven rebounds and five assists. Fifteen of her 21 points came off her five made threes, a career-best for Jones. She has now posted six games in double-figure scoring and two games with 20 or more points this season. GUARDED RESULTS Jasmine Thomas added nine points, six rebounds and three assists in Sunday’s loss to Seattle. Her six rebounds tied her season-high. One of five Sun players who scored in double-figures in the win over Indiana last Wednesday, she finished with 10 points, six assists and four rebounds. It was her 12th game of the season with 10 or more points. Thomas appeared in her 250th career game at Washington (6/26). Four days earlier, she collected her 700th career rebound in the loss at Atlanta (6/22), where she had 13 points, four assists and two rebounds. Thomas matched a career-high with 29 points on 10-of-20 shooting from the field including four made threes in a loss?to Seattle (6/15). Through 17 games, she leads the Sun in assists (4.4 per game), is tied for the team lead in made threes (24) and ranks second in scoring (12.9 ppg). Last year, Thomas averaged a career-best 14.2 points per game. That topped the single-season career-high of 11.7 points per game she had in 2016, which topped the 8.2 points per game she averaged in 2015. In 2017, Thomas had a career- best 54 made threes – 19 more than her previous high – and surpassed 200 for her career. AN EMERGING FORCE Second year forward Brionna Jones had a career night at Indiana (6/24), finishing with new personal highs of 18 points and 10 rebounds on the way to her first double-double in the WNBA. Jones established her previous career-high of 17 points just four games ago at Phoe- nix (6/16), and her recent play has helped offset the continued absence of Alyssa Thomas, who has missed the last eight games with a shoulder injury. Jones had seven points during a key fourth-quarter run that sealed the win for Connecticut last Sunday. She averaged 11.9 points and 7.9 rebounds playing professionally in Russia during the offseason, and has clearly benefited from that experience. PASSING FANCY Coach Curt Miller preaches the importance of moving the basketball and that philosophy has been reflected so far this season. Connecticut has had at least 20 assists in eight games this season, and ranks seventh in the WNBA with an average of 18.82 per game. Connecticut has had at least 25 assists three times. The Sun piled up 27 assists on 37 made shots in a 101-65 win over the Las Vegas Aces (5/20) and 26 assists on 40 made field goals in a 102-94 win over Los Angeles (May 24). HIGH FLYER At 5-foot-8, 136 pounds, Courtney Williams rebounds well above her size. She grabbed six rebounds against Indiana last Wednesday.?A day before, Williams pulled down six boards in Tuesday’s loss at Washington, reaching 100 career offensive rebounds and surpass-?ing 200 career defensive rebounds as well as 300 career rebounds. At Indiana on Sunday, Williams had nine rebounds. It was the fourth time this season she has had at least nine boards in a game. She had nine in the first half at Washington (10/3) on the way to matching her career-high of 10. She is currently averaging six rebounds per game, which is third on the team behind Alyssa Thomas (9.9 rpg) and Chiney Ogwumike (8.0 per game). At her current pace, Williams will finish with 198 rebounds. That would be a remarkable total consider- ing her size and build. Rebounding isn’t her only talent, however. Williams can also score. She added 13 points in the win over Indiana, and has now recorded eight games in double-figures this season. She set a franchise record with 15 made field goals against the Mystics (6/13), finishing with 34 points. That is the most ever by a Sun player in regulation. Pee Wee Johnson had 35 in a triple overtime game against Cleveland in 2002 when the franchise was still in Orlando. In the win at Indiana Sunday, Williams had 12 of Connecticut’s 19 points in the third quarter. She finished with 14 points and also dished out five assists. FOUL DEVELOPMENTS Connecticut starters Jonquel Jones and Chiney Ogwumike played limited minutes at Indiana (6/24) as the Sun continued to be plagued by foul trouble. One game earlier, a franchise-record 35 fouls were called against the Sun in the loss at Atlanta (6/22). That led to 41 free throw attempts and 27 made free throws for the Dream. Through 17 games, the Sun have been called for a league-high 372 fouls. Sun opponents are a combined 302 of 374 at the line. Connecticut has been outscored by 67 points at the free throw line this year. BALANCING ACT Through 17 games, Connecticut has five players averaging more than 10 points per game, and seven different players – Alex Bentley, Chiney Ogwumike, Alyssa Thomas, Jonquel Jones (sharing the top scoring honors at Chicago with Bentley), Jasmine Thomas, Courtney Williams and Rachel Banham – have been a leading scorer in at least one game. Against Los Angeles, Ogwumike, Jones, Alyssa Thomas, Courtney Williams, Jasmine Thomas and Shekinna Stricklen scored in double figures. It was the first time that has happened since August 15, 2017 against the Atlanta Dream. TRIPLE THREAT Versatile forward Alyssa Thomas has now missed eight straight games dealing with a shoulder injury suffered against Washington on June 13. Before the injury, Thomas had been filling up the stat sheet. Before she was injured, she recorded her 800th career rebound?in the loss to the Mystics. She had 11 rebounds against the Lynx – her fourth double-figure rebound game of the season – and ranked third in the WNBA behind only Sylvia Fowles and Liz Cambage in rebound average (9.9) before she was sidelined. She was also second on the team in assist average (4.2 apg) and fourth in scoring (12.0 ppg). Thomas pulled down a career-high 17 rebounds twice this season, dished out five or more assists three times and scored in double figures the first seven games of the year. At Atlanta (6/5), she had 19 points, 17 rebounds and seven assists. Thomas was the WNBA’s first Eastern Conference Player of the Week Award after averaging team-highs of 16.3 points and 10 rebounds with an assist average of 4.3 through the first three games of 2018. In 2017, Thomas aver- aged a career-high 14.8 points with new personal bests for assists (147), made field goals (188), steals (52), rebounds (225), made free throws (114) and minutes (982). She led the Sun in assists and steals. She had a whopping 20 games with at least five assists, and five games with at least eight assists. She also tied the franchise record with seven steals at San Antonio (7/5), and flirted with triple-doubles in back to back games on June 17 at Minnesota (20 points, eight rebounds, eight assists) and New York (12 points, eight rebounds, eight assists). LIKE FATHER, LIKE DAUGHTER With the ninth overall pick in the first round of the 2018 WNBA Draft on April 12th, Connecticut selected Duke guard Lexie Brown. A 5-9 guard who finished her college career with 2,088 points, 587 assists, 455 rebounds, 345 steals and 262 made three-pointers, Brown is the daughter of former Boston Celtics star Dee Brown, who coached the WNBA’s Orlando Miracle in 2002, the season before the team relocated to Connecticut. She is the first daughter of a WNBA head coach to ever be drafted and the fifth Duke player in the last seven years to be taken in the first round. Among the other players on that list is current starting point guard Jasmine Thomas. Brown, who began her college career at Maryland before transferring after two seasons, played with Alyssa Thomas during her two seasons with the Terrapins. Brown is just the third player in Power Five Conference his¬tory to reach 2,000 points, 500 assists, 300 steals and 200 threes _______________EFFICIENCY INSIDE Forward Chiney Ogwumike had another strong outing Friday night, collecting her sixth double-double of the season with 21 points and 12 rebounds in a 78-65 loss to the e Storm. It was the 20th time in 23 games Ogwumike has scored in double figures this season. Ogwumike was 9 of 14 (.643) from the field Friday night, improving her season shooting percentage to .608. On July 13th, she was a remarkable 10 of 11 from the field for 22 points against the Mercury, with her only miss coming on an outside shot as the shot clock was winding down. She is averaging a team best 15.1 points per game, and has a team-high 176 rebounds. Ogwumike had?a career-best 30 points in a loss at Seattle (6/15), and has been consistently productive all season. She missed 2017 with an Achilles tendon injury. Ogwumike will represent the Connecticut Sun on Saturday, July 28th when the 15th WNBA All-Star Game is played at Target Center in Minneapolis. It is the second All-Star selection of her career. GUARDED RESULTS Sun guard Jasmine Thomas was added to the 2017-20 USA Basketball Women’s National Team pool this past Wednesday, joining teammates Chiney Ogwumike, Layshia Clarendon, Morgan Tuck and Courtney Williams. Thomas has a team-best 104 assists, and has scored in double figures 17 times this year. She collected her 250th career steal in the loss to New York (7/11). She appeared in her 250th career game at Washington (6/26), and pulled down her 700th career rebound at Atlanta on June 22. Thomas matched her career-high with 29 points in a loss at Seattle (6/15), making four threes. STRICK STRIKES Shekinna Stricklen had three made three-pointers in the loss the Seattle on Friday night, and she now has 34 on the year, which leads the team. Stricklen has 10 made threes in the last four games. She had a career-best 71 made threes last year. FIELD DAY Connecticut was held to 25 made field goals on just 62 attempts in the loss to Seattle. Those were low numbers for the Sun, who began the night averaging 32.8 made field goals on 73.1 attempts. Connecticut had its 17th game with at least 30 made field goals Tuesday night, finishing 34 of 78 (43.6 percent) against the Dream. The Sun opened the season by making at least 30 field goals in the first 10 games of the year. That included 42 made shots – the second highest total in team history – at Chicago (6/1). Connecticut was also 40 of 64 (62.5 percent) against Los Angeles on May 24. The made field goals and shooting percentage in that win over the Sparks were both the third highest in team history. HIGH FLYER Prior to Friday, Courtney Williams was averaging six rebounds per game. The 5-foot-8 guard tied her career- high with 10 rebounds while scoring a team-high 25 points along with four assists against Phoenix last Friday. She also had 10 rebounds in a win at Washington (6/3), and has scored in double figures 11 times this year. She was averaging 14.8 points, six rebounds and 2.8 assists in the four games before Seattle. Earlier this season, she had 34 points on a team-record 15 made field goals against the Mystics (6/13). That was the most points scored in regulation in the history of the franchise. Shannon Johnson scored 35 points in a triple overtime game against the Cleveland Rockers when the franchise was still located in Orlando. TRIPLE THREAT Veteran forward Alyssa Thomas displayed her versatility once again Tuesday night, finishing with 12 points, 10 rebounds and three assists in the loss to Atlanta. It was her sixth double-double of the season and third in the last four games for the Sun. Thomas narrowly missed a triple-double on the way to 11 points, a career-high 10 assists and eight rebounds last Friday night in a 91-87 win over the Phoenix Mercury. Thomas, who missed 10 games with a shoulder injury suffered against Washington (6/13), is averaging 8.2 points, 8.2 rebounds and 4.6 assists in five games since returning against the Liberty on July 11th. Before the injury, Thomas ranked third in the WNBA in rebounds (9.5 rpg) behind only Sylvia Fowles and Liz Cambage. Thomas had a career-high 17 re- bounds twice this season, and was the first Eastern Conference Player of the Week after opening the season by averaging 16.3 points, 10 rebounds and 4.3 assists in the first three games of the year. ___________________ROOKIE OF THE YEAR WATCH A’ja Wilson leads all WNBA rookies in scoring (21.0) and rebounding (8.7) this season. Below are her ranks among rookies and overall in six categories. Wilson was also named Rookie of the Month for the month of June. THREES COMPANY The Aces are being outscored by just over three points per game so far this season (85.4 to 82.1). Over their last 15 games, however, Las Vegas is outscoring the opposition (83.4 to 82.9) IT CAME FROM BEYOND THE ARC Kayle McBride (27) has more than one third of the Aces’ made three pointers this season (69). THE SPLASH SISTERS Kayla McBride (49) and Kelsey Plum (35) finished first and second on the team in three-pointers a year ago. They are 1st (McBride, 27) and 2nd (Plum, 22) on the team in triples this year. BE ... AGGRESSIVE. B. E.

Clarendon, Hayes and Williams suited up for the national team’s exhibition game against China on Thursday, April 26 in Seattle, Wash. Dream Draft Three in 2018 WNBA Draft The Atlanta Dream selected three standout seniors in the 2018 WNBA Draft. The team selected Monique Billings (UCLA) No. 15 overall, Kristy Wallace (Baylor) at No. 16 and Mackenzie Engram (Georgia) at No. 27 overall. Wallace will sit out the 2018 WNBA season due to an ACL tear suffered in March. Dream Make Splash in 2018 Free Agency Head Coach Nicki Collen wasted no time looking to improve the Dream. The first-year head coach signed two of the?top free agents available in the 2018 class in guard Renee Montgomery (Minnesota) and Jessica Breland (Chicago). Both players are expected to see significant minutes for the Dream in 2018. Layshia Clarendon Stabilizing The Point Position Layshia Clarendon has had a good 12 months.

It was the first back-to-back games in franchise history. The Wings wrapped up their sea- son-opening road trip in Washington with an 87-77 win over the Mystics. The 90-79 win at Indiana is the first W for the franchise as the Dallas Wings.
